# Fiindr Web App
- A simple web app made with ReactJS. I wanted to do a small website trying out the fetch API and some TypeScript concepts that I've just learned, and this is that web app! The whole process of creating this app took about 5 ~ 6 days from designing to coding. Simple and quick app showing the asynchronous JS coding.
